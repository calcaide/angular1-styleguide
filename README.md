## Introduction

This style guide is deprecated and no longer updated. I use it as a reminder or cheat sheet for maintaining legacy code.

Is important to mention that this guide is strictly based in [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015) and in [MVC pattern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). Angular 1.x can ve used in other approaches, but you don't will find it here.

Since Angular 1.5.x and above it is possible to use it with a component based architecture but I never used [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) in this approach, when I decided to move to that architecture I stopped using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) in favor of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

This style guide is the result of in-depth working with Angular (since 2013), having discussions with co-workers and other developers, reading a lot of articles and other style guides that I will mention in [reference style guides](#reference-style-guides).
